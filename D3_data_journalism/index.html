          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Obesity and Poverty</h2>
          <p>There seems to be a weak correlation between poverty and obesity.  This is could be explained by low incoome 
          households relying on inexpensive low-quality foods. The intake of these types of foods, particularly frozen 
          ultra-processed products and fast-foods have a very strong correlation to obesity.</p>

          <p>It is worth mentioning that no matter affluent the state, there is a baseline of obesity. Interestingly enough,
          it seems like higher net-worth individuals are also affected by obesity. This would show that it is to some degree
          related to lifestyle choices and not just access to quality food.</p>

          <p>Time permitting, it would have been interesting to cross this with other variables, such as smoking, to try and 
          determine if obesity and smoking are correlated regardless of income. This could be flagged as more of an attitude 
        towards health and not just a function of available resources.</p>
